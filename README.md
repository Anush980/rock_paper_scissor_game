# rock_paper_scissor_game
this is the basic game that mostly begineers create.
basically in this project,
I used java.util.Random to generate random number.i used scanner to store the number entered by the user.
then simply used if-else statement to get the game running.
in this game i asssigned 0 as rock,1 as paper,2 as scissor.
that's it.
